# @electron/windows-sign [![npm][npm_img]][npm_url]

Codesign your app for Windows. Made for [Electron][electron] but really supports any folder with binary files. `electron-windows-sign` scans a folder for [signable files](#file-types) and codesigns them with both SHA-1 and SHA-256. It can be highly customized and used either programmatically or on the command line. 

# Requirements

By default, this module spawns `signtool.exe` and needs to run on Windows. If you're building an Electron app and care enough to codesign them, I would heavily recommend that you build and test your apps on the platforms you're building for.

# Usage

Most developers of Electron apps will likely not use this module directly - and instead use it indirectly
instead. If you are one of those developers who is using a module like `@electron/forge` or `electron-packager`, you can configure this module with global environment variables. If that describes
you, you can skip ahead to your use case:

 - [With a certificate file and password](#with-a-certificate-file-and-password)
 - [With a custom binary or custom parameters](#with-a-custom-signtoolexe-or-custom-parameters)
 - [With a completely custom hook](#with-a-custom-hook-function)

## Direct Usage

`@electron/windows-codesign` is built to both esm and cjs and can be used both as a module as well as directly from the command line.

```ts
import { sign } from "@electron/windows-sign"
// or const { sign } = require("@electron/windows-sign")

await sign(signOptions)
```

```ps1
electron-windows-sign $PATH_TO_APP_DIRECTORY [options ...]
```

## With a certificate file and password

This is the "traditional" way to codesign Electron apps on Windows. You pass in a certificate file
(like a .pfx) and a password, which will then be passed to a built-in version of `signtool.exe` taken
directly from the Windows SDK. 

```ts
await sign({
  appDirectory: "C:\\Path\\To\\App",
  // or process.env.WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_FILE
  certificateFile: "C:\\Cert.pfx",
  // or process.env.WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD 
  certificatePassword: "hunter99"
})
```

```ps1
electron-windows-sign $PATH_TO_APP_DIRECTORY --certificate-file=$PATH_TO_CERT --certificate-password=$CERT-PASSWORD
``` 

### Full configuration
```ts
// Path to a timestamp server. Defaults to http://timestamp.digicert.com
// Can also be passed as process.env.WINDOWS_TIMESTAMP_SERVER
timestampServer = "http://timestamp.digicert.com"
// Description of the signed content. Will be passed to signtool.exe as /d
// Can also be passed as process.env.WINDOWS_SIGN_DESCRIPTION
description = "My content"
// URL of the signed content. Will be passed to signtool.exe as /du
// Can also be passed as process.env.WINDOWS_SIGN_WEBSITE
website = "https://mywebsite.com"
// If enabled, attempt to sign .js JavaScript files. Disabled by default
signJavaScript = true
```

## With a custom signtool.exe or custom parameters

Sometimes, you need to specify specific signing parameters or use a different version
of `signtool.exe`. In this mode, `@electron/windows-sign` will call the provided binary
with the provided parameters for each file to sign. 

If you only provide `signToolPath`, the default parameters will be used.
If you only provide `signWithParams`, the default `signtool.exe` will be used. 

All the [additional configuration](#additional-configuration) mentioned above is also
available here, but only used if you do not provide your own parameters.

```ts
await sign({
  appDirectory: "C:\\Path\\To\\App",
  // or process.env.WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_FILE
  signToolPath: "C:\\Cert.pfx", 
  // or process.env.WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD
  certificatePassword: "hunter99"
  // or process.env.WINDOWS_SIGN_TOOL_PATH
  signToolPath: "C:\\Path\\To\\my-custom-tool.exe",
  // or process.env.WINDOWS_SIGN_WITH_PARAMS
  signWithParams: "--my=custom --parameters"
})
```

```ps1
electron-windows-sign $PATH_TO_APP_DIRECTORY --sign-tool-path=$PATH_TO_TOOL --sign-with-params="--my=custom --parameters"
```

## With a custom hook function

Sometimes, you just want all modules depending on `@electron/windows-sign` to call
your completely custom logic. You can either specify a `hookFunction` (if you're calling
this module yourself) or a `hookModulePath`, which this module will attempt to require.

Using the `hookModulePath` has the benefit that you can override how any other users
of this module (like `electron-packager`) codesign your app.

```ts
await sign({
  // A function with the following signature:
  // (fileToSign: string) => void | Promise<void>
  //
  // This function will be called sequentially for each file that 
  // @electron/windows-sign wants to sign.
  hookFunction: myHookFunction
  // Path to a hook module.
  hookModulePath: "C:\\Path\\To\\my-hook-module.js",
})
```

Your hook module should either directly export a function or
export a `default` function.
```js
// Good:
module.exports = function (filePath) {
  console.log(`Path to file to sign: ${filePath}`)
}

// Good:
module.exports = async function (filePath) {
  console.log(`Path to file to sign: ${filePath}`)
}

// Good:
export default async function (filePath) {
  console.log(`Path to file to sign: ${filePath}`)
}

// Bad:
module.exports = {
  function (filePath) {
  console.log(`Path to file to sign: ${filePath}`)
}

// Bad:
export async function myCustomHookName(filePath) {
  console.log(`Path to file to sign: ${filePath}`)
}
```

```
SYNOPSIS
  electron-windows-sign app [options ...]

DESCRIPTION
  app
    Path to the application to sign.  It must be a directory.

  certificate-file
    Path to the certificate file (.pfx) to use for signing. Uses 
    environment variable WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_FILE if not provided.

  certificate-password
    Password to use for the certificate. Uses environment variable
    WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD if not provided.

  sign-tool-path
    Path to the signtool.exe binary.  If not specified, the tool will attempt
    use a built-in version.

  timestamp-server
    URL of the timestamp server to use.  If not specified, the tool will
    attempt to use a built-in server (http://timestamp.digicert.com)

  description
    Description to use for the signed files. Passed as /d to signtool.exe.

  website
    URL of the website to use for the signed files. Passed as /du to
    signtool.exe.

  sign-with-params
    Additional parameters to pass to signtool.exe.  This can be used to
    specify additional certificates to use for cross-signing.

  automatically-select-certificate
    Automatically select the best certificate to use for signing. On by default.

  help
    Print this usage information.

  debug
    Print additional debug information.
```

# File Types
This tool will aggressively attempt to sign all files that _can_
be signed, excluding scripts.

- [Portable executable files][pe] (.exe, .dll, .sys, .efi, .scr, .node)
- Microsoft installers (.msi)
- APPX/MSIX packages (.appx, .appxbundle, .msix, .msixbundle)
- Catalog files (.cat)
- Cabinet files (.cab)
- Silverlight applications (.xap)
- Scripts (.vbs, .wsf, .ps1)

If you do want to sign JavaScript, please enable it with the `signJavaScript`
parameter. As far as we are aware, there are no benefits to signing
JavaScript files, so we do not by default.
